  <h1>Coloured Squares</h1>
  <h2>A social art project</h2>
  <p><a href="https://colouredsquares.com">Coloured Squares</a> is a social art project by <a href="http://filipnest.com">Filip Hn&#237;zdo</a>. Hi!</p>
  </p>
  <p>It&#8217;s very much in early stages (which is mildly worrying as it was started in 2010) but here it is, the first proper public beta release (*deep breath*).</p>
  <p>Before I get on to what it actually is (as much as I know), it's worth noting that it would be amazing if you <a href="https://github.com/FilipNest/colouredsquares/issues">reported any bugs you find on GitHub</a>. There are bound to be many.</p>
  <p>It might not even work at all. If so, please get in touch. It can't improve without you.</p>
  <h3>How should it work?</h3>
  <p>Coloured Squares is made up of Squarefields, each of which is tied to a user account.</p>
  <p>Each squarefield has 256 squares, stacked and ordered together in a grid of 16 by 16 squares.</p>
  <p>Each square can be painted or lit in two ways, either with a colour or with an image.</p>
  <p>Every change on the site happens as close to real time as the server can handle.</p>
  <p>Squarefields can be friended allowing people to collect favourites and make friends. A bit like a social network.</p>
  <p>The owner of a squarefield can lock or hide squares from viewing or painting. This can be limited to friends, logged in users, or even just the owner themselves.</p>
  <h3>What can you do with it?</h3>
  <p>Anything you want.</p>
  <p>Some examples:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Paint a picture</li>
    <li>Display your Instagram photographs</li>
    <li>Find images of chess pieces and play chess</li>
    <li>Play whack-a-mole</li>
    <li>Find images of individual letters and spell out words</li>
    <li>Make mazes out of locked squares, perhaps with unlocked squares as a prize.</li>
    <li>Collaborate on something with others.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>If you create any of these or anything else amazing, please get in touch so I can point it out.</p>
  <h3>Development</h3>
  <p>If you want to help out with development or suggest features for Coloured Squares, please <a href="https://github.com/FilipNest/colouredsquares">visit the GitHub page</a>.</p>
  <p>I'll also be using that to track all the features I haven't had a chance to include yet.</p>
  <p>Thank you!</p>
  <p><b>Filip</b>
